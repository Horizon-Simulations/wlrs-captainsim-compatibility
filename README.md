## Known issues and limitations

The project is build-up on top of a payware product from [Captain Sim](https://captainsim.net/). This leads to limitation in key/button assigment in order interact with cockpit elements. For example, lower center display is not a "touch-screen", which makes the checklist INOP, some of the overhead panel are not clickable. Many features in the aircraft are based on default B747-8i Asobo, B787-9 by Horizon Simulations, Salty B747-8i by Salty Simulations.

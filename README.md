## Known issues and limitations

The project is build-up on top of a payware product from [Captain Sim](https://captainsim.net/). This leads to limitation in key/button assigment in order interact with cockpit elements e.g. ADIRU button. Many of these are unclickable at all. Many features in the aircraft are still based on default B747-8i by Asobo which may displays some missing items.
